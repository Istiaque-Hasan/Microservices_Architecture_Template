This project demonstrates a microservices architecture using **NestJS**, **RabbitMQ**, and **MongoDB**. It consists of four independent services:

- **Auth Service**: Handles user authentication, registration, JWT token management, and user profile storage.
- **Product Service**: Manages a product catalog, associates products with users, and enforces authorization.
- **Order Service**: Handles order creation, updates, and integrates with inventory and product services.
- **Inventory Service**: Manages product stock, reservations, and inventory updates.

All services communicate via RabbitMQ and are containerized for independent deployment.

---

## How It Works

- **User Registration/Login**: Auth Service handles user creation and authentication, issues JWT tokens, and publishes `user.created` events.
- **Token Validation**: Product, Order, and Inventory Services validate JWTs by sending a message to Auth Service via RabbitMQ.
- **Product Management**: Product Service allows users to create, read, update, and delete products. Only the product owner can update/delete.
- **Order Management**: Order Service allows users to create, read, update, and delete orders. It checks inventory before creating orders and updates inventory on order changes.
- **Inventory Management**: Inventory Service tracks product stock, handles reservations/releases, and responds to order-service requests.
- **Authorization**: Product and Order Services enforce that only the owner can update or delete their resources, using user ID from validated JWT.
- **Event Publishing**: All services publish relevant events to RabbitMQ for integration and extensibility.

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & Docker Compose
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later, for local dev)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Copy the example env files and fill in the required values:
```bash
cp auth-service/.env.example auth-service/.env
cp product-service/.env.example product-service/.env
cp order-service/env.example order-service/.env
# (create inventory-service/.env if needed, see below)
```

### 3. Start with Docker Compose
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
- Auth Service: http://localhost:3000
- Product Service: http://localhost:3001
- Order Service: http://localhost:3002
- Inventory Service: http://localhost:3003
- RabbitMQ Management: http://localhost:15672 (guest/guest)
- MongoDB: mongodb://localhost:27017

### 4. Local Development (Optional)
Install dependencies and run each service:
```bash
# Auth Service
cd auth-service
npm install
npm run start:dev

# Product Service
cd ../product-service
npm install
npm run start:dev

# Order Service
cd ../order-service
npm install
npm run start:dev

# Inventory Service
cd ../inventory-service
npm install
npm run start:dev
```

## Inter-Service Communication
- **User Registration:** Auth Service publishes `user.created` event to RabbitMQ.
- **Token Validation:** Product, Order, and Inventory Services send a message to Auth Service via RabbitMQ to validate JWT tokens.
- **Product Events:** Product Service publishes `product.created`, `product.updated`, and `product.deleted` events to RabbitMQ.
- **Order Creation:** Order Service checks inventory via RabbitMQ before creating an order, and publishes `order.created` events.
- **Inventory Management:** Inventory Service responds to stock check, reserve, and release requests from Order Service via RabbitMQ.
